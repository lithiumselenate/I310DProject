# Data Visualization and analysis:
Two groups, binary/ muiltiple value groups
difference in orange/blue column ratio is displayed. Other graphs include billing range and other numerical values.

#  Machine learning for prediction
## Accuracy
-  sklearn logistic regression 0.8005677785663591
-  pytorch neural network 0.7324343506032647
-  Notes: tested configurations:
-  10-1
-  10-30-30-30-1
-  10-7-3-1
-  10-5-3-1
-  Accuracy are mostly same of 0.7324

## preprocess.py
-  preprocess the data to numerical valules. Sadly I recalled to use sklearn after I finished this part.
## training.py
-  configure and train neural network. Output learning curve
## testing.py
-  test model.
## fairness.py
-  test model on different genders
